      <h1>National Water Model</h1>
		<h2>Information</h2>
		<p>
				The National Water Model (NWM) is a hydrologic framework that simulates streamflow across the continental U.S., parts of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, 
				and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
				It also provides coastal water level guidance for most of the U.S. Using mathematical models, it represents processes like snowmelt, infiltration, 
				and soil water movement, accounting for factors such as elevation, soil, and vegetation. A model like this is so complex that a high-powered computer 
				is needed to run it, so NOAA publishes the output on this website: <a href="https://water.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">https://water.noaa.gov/</a>
		</p>
			<p>
				Researchers have built an API to make it easier to access the NWM data. It runs on the Google Cloud and is able to withdraw data from the NWM model's 
				storage based on forecast type, date/time, location, etc. in a more efficient manner. In the words of the publishers of the API, <i>"First, we address the major challenge in data 
				usability by transforming the format of the NWM data and storing it in an efficient manner consistent with the needs of the community..."</i> and 
				<i>"Second, we improve access to the data by providing them as public datasets on the cloud with an API for querying to provide quick and easy 
				access for research and operational applications that rely on the NWM data."</i>

			</p>
			<p>The NWM is still being actively worked on and improved. For more information on the model and its version history, see
