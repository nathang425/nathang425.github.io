        Welcome to my personal website. I'm an engineering student at BYU,
        graduating in April 2025. This site and most of its pages were created 
	for the CE514 course at Brigham Young University, 
	taught by Dr. Dan Ames.

      <h1>Southern Oregon Rafting Forecast (SORF)</h1>			
			<h3>
      Welcome!
      </h3>
      <p>
      This app allows you to choose from popular rafting rivers in Southern Oregon, and view their current flow forecasts and flood thresholds.
      </p>
      <p>
      Live flow forecasts come from the National Water Model (<a href="https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm">NWM</a>), managed by NOAA and the National Weather Service. Flow data is updated via an API, and flood thresholds are accurate as of February 2025.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
      Data Warning:
      </h3>
      <p>This app was built for a university project and is not intended for public use. It is for demonstration purposes only, and the API may occasionally return inaccurate data.</p>
